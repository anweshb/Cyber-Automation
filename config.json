Unless you know what you're doing, the only thing you may have to change is the Procmon config file and Procmon location. For logging concerns, you may also change the size limit. Size limit refers to the maximum file size (in megabytes) the Procmon logs are allowed to reached before it is zipped and stored. check_interval is the time in seconds our daemon has to poll to check if the file size limit is reached.",
